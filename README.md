# Remaster 

My inspiration was to update this package for newer Linux distributions that do not have net-tools preinstalled and are switching from `ifconfig` to `ip`

# PwrDeauther
A MDK3 channel deauther script. Fast, easy to use and powerful. (MDK3 is more powerful than Aireplay)

## Dependencies

MDK3 `sudo apt-get install mdk3`: https://github.com/wi-fi-analyzer/mdk3-master

MACCHANGER `sudo apt-get install macchanger` https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger

NMCLI `Preinstalled on most distros.`: https://github.com/mvidner/nmcli

## Notes
Some IntelÂ® Hardware In particular Centrino are known to cause problems becuase of the way mdk3 works. 

From the mdk3 documentaion: 
`MDK3 uses the drivers and Injection routines from this project and its predecessor. Thus, all drivers listed there should work with MDK3. (Some special hardware, like Intel Centrino (ipw2200) is NOT supported since they can only inject data, and no management information!)`
